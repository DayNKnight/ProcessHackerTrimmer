# ProcessHackerTrimmer

This python script was written very quickly and is not tested. It does seem to do what I was expecting, with some exceptions. 

You will need to delete the top three lines that are at the top of the file by default.

For the command to run the program, there are no flags and it only expects one command line argument.
